# About

This little thing approximates PI (only to the 5th place unfortunately). It is written in JS (duh) using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The idea is taken from ThreeBlueOneBrown [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brU5yLm9DZM).

# TODO

- Add better tracing to the Particle

- Mirror Surfaces and the Particle and add special Particle.
